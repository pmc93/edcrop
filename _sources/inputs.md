# Input Files

To use Edcrop, it is crucial to use consistent units for all input. Since all the default values set in Edcrop use millimeter for length and day for time, it is beneficial to use these as units. Otherwise, all required data and parameters need to be specified in the input in order to avoid use of default values set in the code.
All input to Edcrop, except the climate time series, is given in a required text file named edcrop.yaml. The file naming uses the extension “yaml” because the file is structured as a YAML file, and it is read (loaded) by the Python YAML module. The edcrop.yaml file must be available in the working directory when Edcrop is run.

## Structure of input file 'edcrop.yaml'

The edcrop.yaml file is a text file where each line of content is either a blank line, a comment, a key, a key and a value, or the continuation of a value if this needs (or is preferred) to span more than one line of text.

A comment line begins with the hash character,”#”.

A key is a text string which is succeeded by a colon, “:”. The colon is not part of the key.

A value can be:

- A text string – e.g. JB1.
- An integer number – e.g. 23.
- A floating point (real) number – e.g. 7.831, using dot (“.”) as decimal separator; or 3.52e-7 for an
exponential number.
- A date in the format %Y-%m-%d – e.g. 1998-08-31.
- A Boolean – i.e. either True or False.
- A list of either of the above – e.g. a list of three real numbers [3.2, 7.32, 7.5e-3].
- A dictionary – e.g. a dictionary with two entries {‘key_1’: 1.3, ‘key_2’: 2.7}, where an entry has a key
(a text string) and a value (here a real number, but it could be of any type).

A dictionary begins by “{“, and ends by “}”. A colon followed by a space must separate the key and the value, and a comma must separate two entries.
The file information is further structured by line indentation. It is a requirement to carry out line indentation by use of space characters, not by use of tabs! Using tabs will create an error message and program failure
Indentation is used to define a block of information; indented lines contain information belonging to the block. Further indentation defines information belonging to a sub block.
Table 1 shows an example with an input block named “Models”. The block begins with the line with the key “Models”, defining the block name to be “Models”. This line is succeeded by an indented line with the key “M1” defining a sub block of information to “Models”. The following line with key “M2” defines a new sub block to “Models”.
It is required to use exact same indentation for all sub blocks! Otherwise, the file loading fails with an error message! The error message is likely to point to the place in edcrop.yaml causing the loading problem.
In Table 1, sub block “M2” has its own sub-sub-block with key “wbfunc” followed by a value, which is the string “evacrop”.

Table 1 Example of input block in edcrop.yaml file.

```
#This is a comment – beginning with the hash character
Models:
    M1:
    M2:
        wbfunc: evacrop
```

## How Edcrop uses the edcrop.yaml input during execution

If Edcrop loads the “Models” block with the sub blocks in Table 1, it will execute two model runs. First Edcrop will make model run short-named “M1”: because there is no sub block to “M1:” Edcrop will run using default setup and default parameter values; as default, Edcrop uses the conceptualization for evapotranspiration and drainage described in Chapter 4. Second Edcrop will make model run short-named “M2”: this has a sub block with key “wbfunc” and value “evacrop”, which causes execution to use the Evacrop conceptualization for evapotranspiration and drainage described in Chapter 3.

Table 2 shows another example of an edcrop.yaml file containing three blocks, each with one or more sub blocks.

The first block is named “Climates”. Its sub block has a key named “C1”, and this has its own sub block with key “filename” and value (text string) “climate.dat”. This instructs Edcrop, when it executes, to read the required climate data from a file named “climate.dat”. “C1” would typically be a short name that identifies the climate station.

The second block is named “Soils”. It has two sub blocks named “JB1” and “JB7”, respectively. Neither of the sub blocks have its own sub block(s). This instructs Edcrop to execute sequential simulation for each of two default soil types named JB1 and JB2, respectively, without changing any soil parameter value from its default value. Soil descriptions are found below in Chapters 5.5 and 7.2.

The third block is named “Crops”, having two sub blocks named “SB” and “WW”, respectively. These sub blocks also do not have own sub blocks. This instructs Edcrop to execute simulation for two default crop types named SB (spring barley) and WW (winter wheat), respectively, without changing any crop parameter value from its default value.

The edcrop.yaml file in Table 2 thus instructs Edcrop to execute in total four simulations; one simulation for each combination of two soils (JB1 and JB7) and two crops (SB and WW).

Table 2 Example with the three mandatory input blocks of edcrop.yaml file.
```
#This is an edcrop.yaml file with the following three mandatory blocks
#Block defining file with climate data set
Climates:
   C1:
      filename: climate.dat
#Block defining soil types to be simulated
Soils:
   JB1:
   JB7:
#Block defining crops to be simulated
Crops:
   SB:
   WW:
```

If the edcrop.yaml file contained both the “Models” block in Table 1 and the three blocks in Table 2, Edcrop would execute in total eight simulations; a simulation for each combination of two model setups, two soils, and two crops.

It is mandatory that the edcrop.yaml file contains a block for “Climates”, “Soils”, and “Crops”, respectively, like in Table 2.

If the “Models” block is missing, Edcrop uses the default model setup when executing simulations.

In Edcrop, the edcrop.yaml file is loaded in the function named read_inp_file(…). This also stores the “Models”, “Climates”, “Soils”, and “Crops” information in respective Python dictionaries. These dictionaries are used by Edcrop to change settings and parameter values from their default as explained below.

The following sub-chapters give more information about the input regarding model setup, climate data, soils and crops. The sub-chapter titles and content follow the block names in the edcrop.yaml file, i.e. “Models”, “Climates”, “Soils”, and “Crops”.

## “Models” input
The user should use the “Models” block of the edcrop.yaml file to specify model setup and model parameter values only to the extent they need to deviate from their default. If the “Models” block is not present, Edcrop uses the default model setup when executing simulations.

As illustrated in Table 1 and explained in Chapter 5.1, each sub block (indented block) of “Models” specifies a model setup that will be executed when running Edcrop with the respective edcrop.yaml input file. The key of the sub block gives the name of that model execution (e.g. M1 in Table 1), which is also used as model case short name in the naming of output files from this execution (explained in Chapter 6).

A sub block to a sub block (twice-indented block) specifies the desired setting or value by a key and a value, as for key “wbfunc” in Table 1. There can be several of such sub blocks to a sub block, if more than one setting or parameter needs to deviate from its default.

In Chapter 7.1, Table 6 lists all the model settings or model parameter values that can be changed by the edcrop.yaml “Models” input. The Table also gives the respective key and type of value to be specified in the edcrop.yaml file. Table 7 shows a second example of “Models” block input of an edcrop.yaml file.

In Edcrop, default model settings and parameter values are set in `ModelParameters.initialize(…)`. Changing default settings or values by using the edcrop.yaml input happens in `ModelParameters.read_initialize(…)`.
As default, Edcrop uses “wbfunc : ed”, the alternative water balance function described in chapter 4. To use the water balance function from Evacrop instead, set key and value “wbfunc: evacrop”.

## “Climates” input
The mandatory “Climates” block of the edcrop.yaml file specifies what file(s) to read to obtain time series for climate data, i.e. for daily temperature, precipitation, and reference evapotranspiration. If more than one file is specified, Edcrop will execute simulation using each data set sequentially.

As illustrated in Table 3, each sub block (indented block) of “Climates” specifies a climate data input that will be used to execute a simulation when running Edcrop. The key of the sub block gives the climate case short name of that model execution (e.g. Clim_1 in Table 3), which is also used to name the output files from this execution (explained in Chapter 6). The short name typically identifies the corresponding climate station.
A sub block to the sub block (twice-indented block) MUST specify a set of climate data input by using the key “filename” with value being a string, where the string is a valid filename containing the climate data time series.

Another sub block may specify by key “dtformat” a value being a string defining the format of dates to be read from the climate data file. In Table 3, Clim_2 contains this sub block. This instructs Edcrop that dates in the climate file are in the format '%Y%m%d', which could for example be 20200128.

As for Clim_1 in Table 3, if a sub block with key “dtformat” is not specified, Edcrop will read the climate data file using the default format '%Y-%m-%d', which could for example be 2020-01-28.
The climate data file is a CSV file, which is read by Edcrop using `pandas.read_csv(…)`.

Edcrop skips reading the first line of the file. This is because such a line often just names the input of the column beneath. Edcrop uses its own internal naming.

The file must contain four columns of daily data in this order: date, temperature, precipitation, and reference evapotranspiration.

During reading, the date column data are transformed by `pandas.to_datetime(…)` using the date format mentioned above.

Edcrop checks that the succeeding dates in the file increase by 1 day. If this is not the case, Edcrop will not use the file; instead, it writes a message to the screen and in the edcrop.log file, and continues with the next “Climates” input block.

The beginning and end dates of the climate data determine the simulation period.

In Edcrop, a climate data file is read by `TimeSeries.read(…)`.

Table 3 Example of “Climates” input block of edcrop.yaml file.

```
Climates:
    Clim_1:
        filename: climate_station_1.dat
    Clim_2:
        filename: climate_station_2.dat
        dtformat: '%Y%m%d'
```

Table 4 Example of “Soils” input block of edcrop.yaml file. JB1a is a new soil type defined from one of the
default soil types, JB1.

```
Soils:
    JB1:
    JB2:
        kqr: 0.2
    JB1a:
        soiltype: JB1
        name: Very coarse sandy
        thf: [.12, .06, .06, .06]
        kqr: 1.2
```

## “Soils” input

The mandatory “Soils” block of the edcrop.yaml file specifies the soil types simulated during Edcrop execution.

Table 4 shows an example of a “Soils” block specifying, by the first level of indented lines, that three soil types should be simulated; the soil types are named JB1, JB2, and JB1a, respectively. JB1 and JB2 are two of seven predefined soil types in Edcrop (see Chapter 7.2), while JB1a is a new soil type defined for the actual simulation. The user is free to choose any name (key) for a new soil type. During execution, Edcrop uses JB1, JB2, or JB1a, respectively, as soil case short name in the naming of output files from that simulation (see Chapter 6).

Because there are no second level indented lines following the JB1-line in Table 4, the JB1 soil is simulated using entirely default parameter values set in Edcrop.
For the JB2 soil, a second-level indented line follows the JB2-line, having key “kqr” and value equal to 0.2. This instructs Edcrop to simulate the JB2 soil with the drainage rate $k_qr$ set equal to 0.2; for all remaining soil parameters Edcrop uses default values.

A new soil type needs to be defined from one of the predefined soil types. In Table 4, a new soil type, short-named JB1a, is defined from the predefined JB1 soil, which is a coarse sandy type (see Chapter 7.2). The second-level indented line following the JB1a line, using “soiltype” as key and the string “JB1” as value, instructs this. The following second-level indented lines instruct Edcrop to change some soil parameter values from the default values of the JB1 soil.

As an alternative, a new soil type can be coded into Edcrop. This is done in `SoilParameters.initialize(…)`. Thereby the soil type will be “predefined” in Edcrop.

In Chapter 7.2, Table 9 lists all the soil parameter values that can be changed by the edcrop.yaml “Soils” input. The Table also gives the respective key and type of value to be specified in the edcrop.yaml file.
Table 10 shows a second example of “Soils” block input of an edcrop.yaml file.

As default, Edcrop uses the linear drainage model for all soil types. However, if “wbfunc: ed” in the “Models” block, the nonlinear drainage model can be chosen instead by setting “soilmodel: mvg” as illustrated in Table 10 (Chapter 7.2). Also, as default Edcrop uses $K_mp$ = 0, which means there is no macro pore drainage.

## “Crops” input
The mandatory “Crops” block of the edcrop.yaml file specifies the vegetation types simulated during Edcrop execution. The “Crops” block is structured, and used by Edcrop, as described above for the “Soils” block.

Table 5 shows an example of a “Crops” block specifying, by the first level of indented lines, that three vegetation types should be simulated; the types are short-named SB (spring barley), DF (deciduous forest), and WR (winter rape), respectively. SB and DF are two of thirteen predefined vegetation types in Edcrop (see Chapter 7.3), while WR is a new type defined for the actual simulation. (The user is free to choose nay name (key) for a new vegetation type.) For SB and DF, during execution they will have some of their parameter values or settings changed from the default. WR is defined from the predefined type, WW, which is winter wheat, but dates of sow and harvest are changed. During execution, Edcrop uses SB, DF, or WR, respectively, as vegetation case short name in the naming of output files from that simulation (see Chapter 6).

In Table 5, notice that the year is 1900 in the dates for sow and harvest of WR and for “leaflife” of DF. Edcrop does not use the year; it only uses month and day for every simulated year. Therefore, an arbitrary year can be used for the value of these dates.

For permanent use, a new vegetation type can be coded into Edcrop and thereby be “predefined”. This is done in `CropParameters.initialize(…)`.
In Chapter 7.3, Table 12 lists all the vegetation parameter values that can be changed by the edcrop.yaml “Crops” input. The Table also gives the respective key and type of value to be specified in the edcrop.yaml file.
In Edcrop, default vegetation parameter values and growth models are set in `CropParameters.initialize(…)`. Changing default settings or values by using the edcrop.yaml input happens in `CropParameters.read_initialize(…)`.

Table 5 Example of “Crops” input block of edcrop.yaml file. SB and DF are predefined vegetation types for
which Edcrop during execution changes some parameter values from the default. WR is a new
crop type defined from one of the predefined types, WW.
```
Crops:
   SB:
       cb: [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
       cr: 12.
       autoharvest: true
    DF:
        leaflife: [1900-04-15, 1900-06-01, 1900-09-15, 1900-10-15]
    WR:
       croptype: WW
       name: Winter rape
       sowdate: 1900-09-01
       harvestdate: 1900-07-20
```

## Winter season and irrigation season

Edcrop assumes there is no plant growth during winter. By default, the end of October defines the beginning of winter, and the end of February defines the end of winter. The beginning and end of winter can be changed in the “Models” input using the key “winterperiod” (see Chapter 7.1).

Similarly, the irrigation season can be specified by using the “Models” input key “irrigationperiod” (see Chapter 7.1). By default, Edcrop uses end of April as the beginning, and the end of August as the end of the season.

To use Edcrop for Southern Hemisphere conditions, it is obviously necessary to change the winter and irrigation seasons from their default. It will also be necessary to change the dates for the sowing and harvesting of crops as well as the ‘leaflife’ of deciduous forest (see Chapter 7.3). For more permanent use of Edcrop for southern hemisphere conditions, it will be more expediently to change these default values inside the Edcrop code: for default winter and irrigation periods, they should be changed in `ModelParameters.initialize`; for the crop and forest related parameters, they should be changed in `CropParameters.initialize`.
